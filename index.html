    <h1>Effects of recreational marijuana on Aotearoa</a></h1>

        height="300"></a>
    <p>Unfortunately, in the country of Aotearoa, the use of recreational marijuana has 
        recently become a major trend amongst young people. As more and more people
        become attracted to recreational marijuana from their peers, this introduces new
        devastating consequences for our current generation and the future generation to
        come. New problems arising for New Zealand include more addictions (once
        addicted, it is very hard to stop), more health problems (cancer, heart attack,
        mental health...), more relationship problems, more careless and reckless
        behaviour, and more premature deaths both from physical health problems and
        dangerous behvaiour (i.e. car accidents). It would  be very sad and a waste to see our
        sophisticated and developed nation getting ruined by these harmful substances.
        We need to save ourselves by banning recreational marijuana, raising awareness of
        what we are doing to ourselves, avoiding peer pressure to take recreational
        marijuana, quitting recreational marijuana (for those who have already started
        taking marijuana before they become addicted), and go to helpline/treatment
        programmes (for those who are already addicted and struggling to stop).

    <h2>List of issues:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Dangerous driving/car-crashes</h3>
                <img src="img/Screenshot 2024-05-25 at 1.31.50 AM.png"
                height="300">
                <p>From past records, alcohol and drugs have been known to cause 40% of fatal crashes 
                 (with 13% alcohol alone, 9% alcohol and drugs, and 18% drugs alone). Most of this proportion 
                 came from 20- to 24-year-old young adults (with 60% of all fatal crashes involving alcohol/drugs) 
                 and 25- to 29-year-olds (65%).  The statistics were so high to the point where the
                NZTA (New Zealand Transport Agency) needed to make an ad not to smoke drugs (which was an expensive ad to 
                make that they wouldn’t make for no reason), which is shocking. If more and more young people become addicted 
                to recreational marijuana and pass down the trend to the next generation, then there is a very high chance that
                we will be witnessing more fatal car crashes in the future of our country.</p>

                <h3>Physical and Mental Health Problems</h3>
                    <h4>Cancer</h4>
                    <img src="img/Screenshot 2024-05-25 at 1.48.25 AM.png"
                    height="300">
                    <p>Recreational Marijuana has been known to damage the lungs and cause cancer just like tobacco cigarettes
                    due to them both containing the same cancer-causing carcinogens. Contrary to popular belief that recreational
                    marijuana is less harmful than tobacco cigarettes, a New Zealand study has shown that smoking marijuana is 5 
                    times more harmful to the respiratory system than a cigarette would. If not from dangerous driving, we will 
                    also witness higher mortality rates from cancer in the future of our country with our current trend.</p>
                    <h4>Depletion of mineral body storage</h4>
                    <img src="img/Screenshot 2024-05-25 at 2.20.35 AM.png"
                    height="300">
                    <p>Additionally, marijuana also destroys the body natural reserves. The human body is naturally responsive 
                    to the dietary mineral magnesium (which acts as a “tranquilizer” as a nutrient that helps relaxes one and 
                    relieves stress). By using marijuana, it depletes the stores of magnesium in the body, resulting in the 
                    person feeling agitated when the euphoria wears down. Unsurprisingly, people normally reuse the drug to feel
                    good again, thereby making them become more and more physically and emotionally dependent on it.</p>
                    <h4>Mental health problems</h4>
                    <img src="img/Screenshot 2024-05-25 at 1.53.37 AM.png"
                    height="300">
                    <p>During a psychosis, one gets paranoid or loses understanding of reality, so they hear or see things that 
                    are not there and can have long-lasting odd thoughts (psychosis lessens once euphoria disappears).  
                    Although short-term, psychosis can also be a symptom of a long-term medical condition called “schizophrenia”. 
                    Schizophrenia also affects one’s understanding of reality, but additionally it includes other symptoms, like trouble with 
                    speech, the inability to focus and show emotions. Recent research suggests that for those who frequently use marijuana from 
                    a young age for a long time, there is a risk of them developing these mental conditions. Young males, especially 16-25 years
                    old, could be at a higher risk. Once schizophrenia is developed, withdrawal from marijuana won’t solve it.                                                								                            
                    Mental health issues are already very common in today’s era and if the trend of taking recreational marijuana keeps going on 
                    like this, then in the future, this country will be experiencing an even larger mental health crisis amongst young people.</p>

                <h3>Thought Distortion</h3>
                <img src="img/Screenshot 2024-05-25 at 2.00.23 AM.png"
                height="300">
                <p>Recreational marijuana can also distort one’s thinking by clouding their senses and judgement. The effects depend on many different factors, including the marijuana’s potency,
                    how it was taken, and the past intake of it. Different effects include:</p>
                <p>1. Strengthening one’s senses (making eyes and ears more sensitive)</p>
                <p>2. Distort one’s sense of time</p>
                <p>3. Jeopardise motor skills, or skills involving muscles for completing certain actions (which plays a part in making driving more dangerous)</p>
                <p>4. Lower inhibition</p>
                <p>Because recreational marijuana clouds a person’s senses and judgement, this can affect a person’s life in so many aspects (for example, dangerous/reckless behaviour (i.e. car accidents)
                putting their lives and other people’s lives in danger, affecting their relationships with other people around them (i.e. the way they communicate with other people), affecting their work/academic performance, etc.). With these problems arising, if the recreational marijuana trend continues to live on to the next generation, then in the future, this could potentially be large enough to leave a very bad impression on our country and remove our country from the list of being one of the most-friendliest/happiest/peaceful countries in the world.</p>
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Surgery Complications:</h3>
                <p>Marijuana can also cause complications for those who have surgery. Complications include:</p>
                <p>1. Having stomach contents coming into one’s throat</p>
                <p>2. Having a heart attack</p>
                <p>3. For those who need more anaesthesia, they are a greater risk of low blood pressure and a delayed wake-up post-surgery</p>
                <p>4. Breathing issues</p>
                <p>5. Complications post-surgery (including continuous pain and reliance on opioids)</p>
                <p>Again, if we are going to see a future of too many young people taking recreational marijuana, then there will
                be a higher chance of more hospital patients being recreational marijuana users themselves, which would mean 
                there will be a higher chance of more hospital patients experiencing surgery complications around the country. 
                Below is a diagram of how marijuana affects the lungs:</p>

            <li>
                <h3>Addiction</h3>
                <img src="img/Screenshot 2024-05-25 at 2.15.45 AM.png"
                height="300">
                <p>Another issue with recreational marijuana becoming a trend is the addiction. According to the CDC 
                 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), 1 out of 10 people using marijuana will develop an addiction to 
                 it or have cannabis-use disorder. Once a person becomes addicted to using marijuana, they can’t stop using it 
                 even if it destroys their relationships, academics, career, health, or finances. Similar to chronic conditions 
                 like schizophrenia, young people with heavy usage of marijuana are at a higher risk of developing cannabis-use 
                 disorder. For example, the chances of addiction are 1 in 6 amongst teenagers or even ½ for those who use it 
                 daily.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Second-hand smoking</h3>
                <img src="img/Screenshot 2024-05-25 at 2.05.25 AM.png"
                height="300">
                <p>Another issue with too many young people taking recreational marijuana is the
                    second-hand smoking for the people around them (including bystanders). Even for
                    people who are not actually smoking marijuana, once they come into contact with
                    it, studies have shown that exposure to second-hand marijuana impairs blood
                    vessel function. Studies have been shown on rats that for those that have been
                    exposed to marijuana for half an hour, they have been having larger impairment of
                    blood vessel function than for those being exposed to cigarette smoking instead. 
                    If the current generation doesn’t stop with this recreational marijuana trend, 
                    then in the future, there will be more second-hand marijuana smoke prevalence out in
                    the streets around New Zealand, which means that more people (including non-marijuana users) 
                    and even tourists will experience health problems as well from the second-hand smoke alone.</p>
